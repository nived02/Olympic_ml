Olympic Medal prediction using Linear Regression
In this project , I have completed the full process of building a beginner machine learning project. This includes creating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring error. By the end, I understood how to build an end-to-end machine learning project using Python and Jupyter.

To make this interesting, I used a fun dataset from historical Olympic games. I aimed to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.

Most machine learning projects follow a similar outline, which I also followed here. This outline helps tackle any machine learning problem.

Project Steps

Form a hypothesis.
Find and explore the data.
(If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
Clean the data for ML.
Pick an error metric.
Split your data.
